This is because they are highly specialised and therefore less able to adapt to changing environments than other birds. Less than a third of the 727 species of water birds use diving as a method of food-seeking.\n",

The male members of one of these species, named Craugastor candelariensis, can grow only up to 13 mm. These are direct-developing frogs that don't hatch as tadpoles but as fully-formed frogs. They live in the dark, humid leaf litter of the forests.",
